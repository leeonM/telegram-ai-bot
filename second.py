Here are some midweek options that might work:\n\n**Dinner with a Vibe:**\n\n* **Moloko Paris:** This restaurant has a calm and relaxed atmosphere and plays hip hop/Afrobeats music.  It's a great option for a chill dinner with friends.\n* **Staya:**  This restaurant serves delicious food (like lamb chops!) and plays hip hop/Afrobeats music.  It's a great option for a more lively dinner.\n* **Kalamata Paris:**  If you're in the mood for Greek food with a party vibe, Kalamata is a great option.  Be sure to book in advance! \n* **Matignon:** This is a good choice if you want a bit more of a upscale dinner experience. It's a bit pricey, but the food is excellent, and the atmosphere is lively. They stop serving food around 1:30 am, and then the downstairs club opens. It's more of a house music vibe, but might be worth checking out if you're looking for a later night.\n\n**Drinks with a Beat:** \n\n* **Lib Paris:** This event space hosts \"Food and Mix\" events on set dates, which feature food, drinks, and dancing to hip hop, afrobeats, and other black-oriented music genres.  They usually have an older crowd (25+) but you might find a good mix of ages.\n* **Chez Tania Paris:** This is a bottle service club that plays hip hop on Saturdays and Sundays, but it's worth checking if they have anything going on midweek.  They might have special events or DJs playing.\n* **Undercover.exp:**  This event offers good hip hop, dancehall, and afrobeats music with a younger vibe (21-25) and really cheap tables (150 euros for a bottle and the table).\n* **RnB Cruise:**  This event takes place on Wednesdays during the summer, but you might be able to find other one-off events hosted by the promoters, like their RnB all-white party that happens at the end of December. \n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* **Check Instagram:**  Many of these spots have active Instagram pages, which are a great way to get a feel for their vibe and see what events they're hosting.  \n* **Check for Midweek Events:**  Many of the events listed in the spreadsheet are for weekends, so be sure to check their websites or social media to see if they have any special events or DJ nights during the week.\n\nI hope this helps!
